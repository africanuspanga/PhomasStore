Based on the documents and requests you've shared, I can give you a deep dive into the primary eCOUNT ERP API endpoints. This is the "map" you need to navigate the system's capabilities.

The key to understanding these URLs is to remember the two placeholder variables that are unique to your setup:

* **`{ZONE}`**: Your specific eCOUNT instance zone. You've already confirmed this is **`IA`**.
* **`{SESSION_ID}`**: The session ID you get after a successful login. It is valid for a limited time.

Here are the most common endpoints, categorized by their function.

### **1. Authentication Endpoints**

This is always the first step. You `POST` your company code and authentication key to the login API to receive your `SESSION_ID`.

| Endpoint | Method | URL Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Login** | `POST` | `https://oapi{ZONE}.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/Login` |

### **2. `GET` Endpoints: For Reading Data**

These endpoints are used to "pull" or retrieve data from your ERP, such as inventory levels, customer lists, or past sales records. They use a **`GET`** method and do not require a JSON body.

| Endpoint | Method | URL Format | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GetProductList** | `GET` | `https://oapi{ZONE}.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/Product/GetProductList?SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}` | Retrieves all your product information, including inventory balances. This is the call you'll need for your external shop. |
| **GetCustomerList** | `GET` | `https://oapi{ZONE}.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/Customer/GetCustomerList?SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}` | Retrieves a list of all customers in your ERP. |
| **GetSalesList** | `GET` | `https://oapi{ZONE}.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/Sales/GetSalesList?SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}` | Retrieves a list of past sales orders. You can usually filter this by date. |
| **GetJobOrderList** | `GET` | `https://oapi{ZONE}.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/JobOrder/GetJobOrderList?SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}` | Retrieves a list of your job orders. |

### **3. `POST` Endpoints: For Creating or Updating Data**

These endpoints are used to "push" or save data to your ERP. They require a **`POST`** method and a JSON body containing the data you want to save. 

| Endpoint | Method | URL Format | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SaveSale** | `POST` | `https://oapi{ZONE}.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/Sales/SaveSale?SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}` | Creates a new sales record in your ERP. |
| **SaveQuotation** | `POST` | `https://oapi{ZONE}.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/Quotation/SaveQuotation?SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}` | Creates a new quotation. The JSON payload is different from a sales record. |
| **SaveJobOrder** | `POST` | `https://oapi{ZONE}.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/JobOrder/SaveJobOrder?SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}` | Creates a new job order. This endpoint uses a `BulkDatas` structure as we've already identified. |
| **SaveCustomer** | `POST` | `https://oapi{ZONE}.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/Customer/SaveCustomer?SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}` | Creates a new customer record. |
| **SaveProduct** | `POST` | `https://oapi{ZONE}.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/Product/SaveProduct?SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}` | Creates a new product item in your ERP. |

I recommend you bookmark this list. Now that you have the URLs and methods, you can test each one with your `ZONE` and `SESSION_ID` to understand their specific data requirements.
