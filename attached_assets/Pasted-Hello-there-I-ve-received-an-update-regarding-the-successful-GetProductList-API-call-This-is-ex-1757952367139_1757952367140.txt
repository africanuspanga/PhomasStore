Hello there.

I've received an update regarding the successful `GetProductList` API call. This is excellent news! It means that the core issues with authentication and endpoint communication are now completely resolved. The API is functioning as it should.

Here's a breakdown of what the latest result means and a quick explanation for you as the developer.

### **The Current Situation**

* **API Connection is a GO:** The `GetProductList` endpoint successfully returned a `200` status code, which means your system is now correctly authenticating with the eCOUNT server and the API is receiving and processing your request. This is a major win.

* **The `Data count: 0` Result:** This is not a technical issue with the API call itself. The API is simply telling you that, based on the request it received, there are currently **zero products** that match your criteria in the system.

### **What This Means for the `WH_CD` Parameter**

The user has highlighted the importance of the `ECOUNT_WAREHOUSE_CODE` (which we've identified as `00001`). This is the key piece of information you need to send to the API.

While the `GetProductList` endpoint works without a warehouse code, it's possible it's only looking for products with a zero inventory balance or a generic category. By explicitly adding the `WH_CD` parameter, you are telling the API to filter the results and look for products *specifically within that warehouse*.

**For your `GetProductList` API call, you need to add a query parameter to the URL.**

The URL will now look like this:

`https://oapi{ZONE}.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/Product/GetProductList?SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}&WH_CD=00001`

**Why this is different from our previous requests:**

* **`GET` Request:** This is a `GET` request, so all parameters are passed directly in the URL using the `?` and `&` syntax.
* **`WH_CD` as a Query Parameter:** We are adding `&WH_CD=00001` to the end of the URL to specify that we want to retrieve products from warehouse `00001`.

**Your next steps should be to:**

1.  **Append `&WH_CD=00001`** to the end of your `GetProductList` URL.
2.  **Resend the request.**

This should hopefully return a list of products and confirm that the issue was just a matter of specifying the correct warehouse for the API to look in.
