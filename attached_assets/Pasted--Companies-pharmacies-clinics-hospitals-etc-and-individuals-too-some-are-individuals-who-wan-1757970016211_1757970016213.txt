üîß What I Need From You
Immediate Requirements:
Supabase Account - I have an account so what details do you need?
Company Types - What types of companies should be able to register? (Pharmacies, Clinics, Hospitals, Distributors, all these and allow individuals too) 
Company Information - What business details do you want to collect during registration? Name, email, phone number and they should create their own password 
Company name, registration number, license info, address, contact person, etc.
Business Logic Questions:
User Roles - Should companies have multiple user types? (just Admin)
Verification Process - Do you want to manually approve company registrations? - no need if someone register they should go straight to the store 
Pricing/Plans - Will different company types have different access levels - no all the same 
Integration with eCount - Should company orders sync with your eCount ERP? - yes they have too but we will do this later 
Technical Preferences:
Current Data - Do you have existing users that need to be migrated? - no project is just starting 
Email Verification - Should companies verify email addresses during registration? - no need 
Password Requirements - Any specific password complexity requirements? - Standard atleast 8 characters
