1. Issue Test Authentication Key
○ Prior to issuing an authentication key, a request with a test authentication key is required for
verification.
○ Login to ERP (a href='https://login.ecount.com' target=_blank>https://login.ecount.com
https://login.ecount.com/a>) and issue an authentication key in User Customization >
Information > API Authentication Key Issuance > API Authentication Status > Issue button.
○ An authentication key is valid for 2 weeks since issued.
○ An authentication key can be issued up to 3 times, and an additional issuance is available
upon request and review.
2. Dev. Verification
○ For API verification, you need to verify only the API you want to use, not all items.
○ Requests with a test authentication key will be examined by ECOUNT, and if acceptable, their
verification will automatically proceed.
※ If the data requested with a test authentication key is transmitted successfully, it will be
turned to Verification status.
○ Verification will be completed once a request is made to the test URL
http://sboapi.ecount.com and the transmission is successful.
※ As for directly running API, if running in the URL http://sboapi.ecount.com page, you can
log in with the test authentication key.
○ Verification is limited to requested API, and if you want to use an additional API, please
submit an additional request by using a test authentication key.
○ You can verify the list of authenticated API in User Customization > Information > API
Authentication Key Issuance > API Authentication Status.
3. Issue Authentication Key
○ You have to issue an authentication key to use Ecount Open API.
○ To issue the authentication key, log onto the ERP ( https://login.ecount.com ) and go to User
Customization > Information > API Authentication Key Issuance.
○ The issued authentication key is valid for one year.
4. Use Open API
○ You need a session ID to call the Ecount Open API and the session ID can be issued by
using the Login API.
○ The issued session ID is valid for time set in the program (ERP Login > User Customization >
Configuration > Security Setup > Session Timeout), and you can call the Sale API or Sales
Order API to renew the session time.
※ If you don't call Sales/Sales Order API within the set time, the session ID will expire and
you will have to have a new session ID issued again with the Login API.
○ In order to use the Input API such as Sales Order, Sales, etc., the fields must be added to the
ECOUNT Web Uploader.
※ ECOUNT Web Uploader Settings can be accessed from each input menu > Web Uploader
Button at the bottom > Add Web Uploader Fields.
