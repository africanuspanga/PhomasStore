Subject: Re: InventoryBalance API Access - Confirmed Using Correct Production URL

Dear eCount Support Team,

Thank you for your response. I want to confirm that we are already using the correct production "Request URL" as documented in eCount API documentation.

✅ CONFIRMED: WE ARE USING THE DOCUMENTED PRODUCTION URL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Our current implementation matches your official documentation exactly:

From eCount Documentation (Line 18):
  Inventory Balance: https://oapi{ZONE}.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/InventoryBalance/GetListInventoryBalanceStatus?SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}

Our Actual Request:
  URL: https://oapiIA.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/InventoryBalance/GetListInventoryBalanceStatus?SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}
  Zone: IA (from Zone API)
  Auth Key: 01bfa323...[ends]...eb59 (production key, not verification key)

✅ PROOF: OTHER ENDPOINTS WORK WITH SAME URL PATTERN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
These endpoints work successfully with identical URL structure:

✅ https://oapiIA.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/OAPILogin?SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}
   → Result: Login successful, receive session ID and cookies

✅ https://oapiIA.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/SaleOrder/SaveSaleOrder?SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}
   → Result: Orders saved successfully (Orders #20251021-3 and #20251021-4)

❌ https://oapiIA.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/InventoryBalance/GetListInventoryBalanceStatus?SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}
   → Result: HTTP 500 "Please login" error

AUTHENTICATION DETAILS (All Correct)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Using production base URL: https://oapi{ZONE}.ecount.com (NOT sboapi)
✅ Using production auth key: 01bfa323...eb59 (1-year validity key)
✅ Session ID in URL query parameter: SESSION_ID={SESSION_ID}
✅ Session ID in request body: SESSION_ID field included
✅ API_CERT_KEY in request body: Included
✅ Cookies from login: Captured and replayed
✅ Verification status: VERIFIED (completed)

REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Since we are using the exact URL from your documentation and our authentication works for SaveSaleOrder, could you please:

1. Check if the InventoryBalance endpoint is ACTIVATED on your server for our production API key?
2. Verify that our API key has permissions for inventory endpoints (not just sales endpoints)?
3. Confirm that warehouse code 00001 has the necessary permissions for inventory queries?

HYPOTHESIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The "Please login" error appears to be a permission/activation issue on the server side, not a URL or authentication problem, because:

- Same authentication credentials work for SaveSaleOrder ✅
- Same URL pattern used successfully for other endpoints ✅
- We're using the production URL and production auth key ✅
- The only difference is the specific endpoint: InventoryBalance ❌

ACCOUNT INFORMATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Company Code: 902378
User ID: TIHOMBWE
Warehouse: 00001
API Key: 01bfa323...[ends]...eb59

Could you please check your server-side configuration for our account and confirm that InventoryBalance endpoints are enabled?

Thank you for your help!
