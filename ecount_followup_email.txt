Subject: Re: InventoryBalance API Access Request - Clarification on "Request URL"

Dear eCount Support Team,

Thank you for your quick response!

You mentioned using the "Request URL" for actual data transmission after verification is complete. I want to confirm we're using the correct URL.

CURRENT CONFIGURATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
We are currently using:
- Base URL: https://oapi{ZONE}.ecount.com (production URL, not sboapi)
- Zone: IA (detected via Zone API)
- Full InventoryBalance URL: https://oapiIA.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/InventoryBalance/GetListInventoryBalanceStatus
- Authentication Key: 01bfa323...[ends]...eb59 (production key, not verification key)

WORKING ENDPOINTS WITH SAME URL PATTERN:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ https://oapiIA.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/OAPILogin - SUCCESS
✅ https://oapiIA.ecount.com/OAPI/V2/SalesOrder/SaveSaleOrder - SUCCESS

CLARIFICATION NEEDED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Could you please clarify what you mean by "Request URL"?

1. Should InventoryBalance use a DIFFERENT base URL than https://oapi{ZONE}.ecount.com?
   (For example: a different domain or path pattern?)

2. Or are you confirming that https://oapiIA.ecount.com is correct, and the issue is something else?

3. Is there a specific endpoint documentation or URL format we should reference for InventoryBalance after verification?

VERIFICATION STATUS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Our eCount interface shows "VERIFIED" status. We have completed verification and are ready for production data transmission.

We want to ensure we're using the exact URL pattern you expect for InventoryBalance in production mode. Any specific URL or endpoint documentation you can share would be very helpful!

Thank you for your continued support.
