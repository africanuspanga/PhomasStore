Subject: InventoryBalance API Access Request - Company 902378 (PHOMAS DIAGNOSTICS)

Dear eCount Support Team,

We are experiencing an issue with the InventoryBalance API endpoint and need your assistance.

PROBLEM:
The InventoryBalance API (/OAPI/V2/InventoryBalance/GetListInventoryBalanceStatus) returns HTTP 500 "Please login" error, even though our authentication is working correctly.

PROOF AUTHENTICATION IS WORKING:
✅ SaveSaleOrder API works perfectly (orders #20251021-3 and #20251021-4 successfully submitted)
✅ Login API works (we receive valid session ID and cookies)
✅ Zone API works

❌ InventoryBalance API fails with same credentials

ACCOUNT DETAILS:
- Company Code: 902378
- User ID: TIHOMBWE  
- API Key: 01bfa323...[ends]...eb59 (valid until October 2026)
- Warehouse: 00001
- Zone: IA

REQUEST:
Could you please:
1. Verify InventoryBalance endpoint is activated for our production API key
2. Confirm warehouse 00001 has inventory query permissions
3. Check our API scope includes InventoryBalance/InventoryBasic endpoints

We suspect the endpoint may need to be enabled on your side, as our authentication works for other endpoints.

Thank you for your help!
