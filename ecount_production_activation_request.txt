Subject: Re: InventoryBalance Verified but Not Working with Production Key

Dear eCount Support Team,

Thank you for verifying the InventoryBalance API. I can see from my API Authentication Status page that both APIs show "Verification" status:

✅ Sales API - New Sales Order - VERIFICATION COMPLETE
✅ (Inv.)Reports API - Inventory Balance - VERIFICATION COMPLETE

HOWEVER - THE PROBLEM:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
While the verification status shows "Verification", the InventoryBalance API still returns "Please login" error when we use our PRODUCTION Authentication Key.

VERIFICATION vs PRODUCTION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
I understand that:
- ✅ Verification was completed using the TEST Authentication Key
- ❌ Production use requires activation with our PRODUCTION Authentication Key

Our verification page note states:
"For additional API development, please use it after Verification with the Test Authentication Key."

CURRENT SITUATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Production Authentication Key: 01bfa323...[ends]...eb59 (Valid until October 2026)

Testing Results:
✅ SaveSaleOrder with production key → SUCCESS (orders #20251021-3, #20251021-4 saved)
❌ InventoryBalance with production key → HTTP 500 "Please login"
❌ InventoryBasic with production key → HTTP 500 "Please login"

REQUEST:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Could you please ACTIVATE the following APIs for our PRODUCTION Authentication Key?

1. InventoryBalance/GetListInventoryBalanceStatus
2. InventoryBalance/ViewInventoryBalanceStatus  
3. InventoryBasic/GetBasicProductsList
4. InventoryBasic/ViewBasicProduct

These APIs show "Verification" status, which I believe means they passed the test phase. 
Now we need them activated for production use with our production authentication key.

BUSINESS NEED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
We are PHOMAS DIAGNOSTICS, a medical supply company in Tanzania. Our e-commerce website needs real-time inventory data to show product availability to customers. Currently, we can only submit orders (via SaveSaleOrder), but cannot display stock levels.

CONFIRMATION NEEDED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Please confirm:
1. Is there a separate activation step required to move from "Verification" to "Production"?
2. Do you need any additional information from us to activate these endpoints?
3. How long does production activation typically take after verification is complete?

P.S. I have attached a screenshot showing both APIs with "Verification" status.
